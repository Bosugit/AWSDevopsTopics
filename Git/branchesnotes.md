Master Branch:

The master branch is often considered the main branch or the production-ready branch in a Git repository.
It should ideally contain stable, thoroughly tested code that is ready for deployment to production.
It's typically the branch from which other branches are created and merged back into after their changes have been reviewed and approved.


Release Branch:

A release branch is used to prepare a new version of the software for release.
It's created from the master branch when the codebase reaches a state where a new release is imminent.
Once created, it's used for final testing, bug fixing, and any necessary adjustments to prepare for deployment.
After all the necessary changes have been made and the release is ready, it's merged back into the master branch, and often tagged with a version number for reference.


Feature Branch:
Feature branches are used to work on new features or enhancements in isolation from the main codebase.
They are typically created from the master branch and contain changes related to a specific feature or task.
Feature branches allow developers to work independently on different features without interfering with each other's work.
Once the feature is complete and tested, it can be merged back into the master branch through a pull request or merge request.


MyProjBranch (Personal Branch):
This type of branch is a personal workspace for individual developers to work on their tasks or experiments.
It's often used for trying out new ideas, experimenting with code changes, or fixing bugs without affecting the main development branches.
Developers can work freely in their personal branches, and once they're satisfied with their changes, they can merge them into appropriate branches (like feature branches) for further review and integration.


****************************************************************



Proj Branch (Personal Branch):
A developer starts working on a new task or feature in their personal branch (proj branch).
They create the branch from the latest version of the master branch.
The developer makes several commits to the proj branch as they implement and test their changes. These commits are specific to the task they're working on and may include bug fixes, new features, or improvements.



Feature Branch:

Once the developer completes their work in the proj branch and is ready to integrate it into the main codebase, they create a feature branch from the master branch.
They merge their changes from the proj branch into the feature branch.
The developer continues to make any necessary adjustments and commits to the feature branch to ensure that the changes are complete and cohesive.


Testing and Code Review:

After completing the changes in the feature branch, the developer may push the branch to a central repository where it can be accessed by other team members.
The changes are then subjected to testing to ensure they meet the project's requirements and standards.
Additionally, other developers may review the code changes in the feature branch to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.



Merge to Release Branch:

Once the changes in the feature branch have been thoroughly tested and reviewed, they are merged into a release branch.
The release branch is used to prepare the changes for deployment and further testing in a staging environment.
Any necessary bug fixes or adjustments are made in the release branch to ensure the stability of the upcoming release.


Merge to Master Branch:

After the changes in the release branch have been verified and deemed ready for production, they are merged into the master branch.
This merge signifies that the changes are now part of the main codebase and are ready to be deployed to production.
The master branch should always contain stable, production-ready code.
During this process, each branch accumulates commits specific to its purpose:

Proj Branch: Commits related to the developer's work on a specific task or feature.

Feature Branch: Commits related to integrating and refining the changes made in the proj branch.
Release Branch: Commits related to preparing the changes for deployment and addressing any issues identified during testing.
Master Branch: Commits representing stable, production-ready code that has been merged from the release branch.
This hierarchical workflow ensures that code changes are developed, tested, and integrated in a controlled manner, helping to maintain the stability and quality of the software project.
