man ls

in shell script: use this  #!/bin/sh  or #!/bin/ksh

chmod u+x filename
     u means user/owner
     +x means execute permissions 

or chmod 755 filename

   In this numeric notation:

7 sets read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions for the owner.
5 sets read (4) and execute (1) permissions for the group and others.
So, 755 gives the owner full permissions (read, write, execute), and read and execute permissions to the group and others.


formula: 

   7:   4---->Read 
        2----->write
        1----->execute
