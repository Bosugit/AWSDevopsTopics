refer:D:\k8s\ShellScripting\nodehealth.sh

commands:

    ps -ef  (f for fullformat)

    ps -ef | grep "amazon"

    ./test.sh | grep 1



awk is powerfull command

if you want to get only processed id 

 ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F" " '{print $2}'

 vim test
 ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F" " '{print $2}'



 points:

 when you are using pipe in your script ,you have to ensure specific syntax 

 set -e  #exits the script when there is an error.This command drawback is it will not error out when there is pipeline.thats why we used belowm command
 set -o pipefail

 by default when you set -e command you have to use set -o pipefail

   set -x
   set -e
   set -o pipefail
