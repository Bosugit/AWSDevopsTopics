q)How the changes outside of the terraform synch with state file?

     Resource is modified manually: If you or someone else modifies a resource directly in your cloud provider's console or CLI, Terraform won't be aware of those changes. In this case, you can use the terraform import command to import the existing resource into your Terraform state. This updates the state file with the current attributes of the resource.

Resource is deleted manually: If a resource is deleted outside of Terraform (e.g., through the cloud provider's console), Terraform won't know about it unless you manually remove it from the state file. This can be risky because Terraform might still try to manage the resource, leading to errors. To avoid this, you can use the terraform state rm command to remove the resource from the state file.

State file is lost or corrupted: If your state file is lost or corrupted for any reason, you can use the terraform import command to re-import all resources into a new state file. However, this can be time-consuming, especially for large infrastructures.

Using remote state management: Terraform also supports remote state management, where the state file is stored remotely (e.g., in an S3 bucket). In this case, Terraform fetches the latest state from the remote storage before making any changes and updates the state after applying changes. This helps ensure that the state file is always up to date and shared among team members.

q)Do you know what is terraform refresh command does?
