what are all the tasks we can achive by using ansible handlers in realtime?

1. Service Management
Restart Services: When configuration files change, handlers can restart services to apply the new settings.
Reload Services: For services that support reloading (like web servers), handlers can reload the configuration without fully restarting the service.
Stop/Start Services: Handlers can stop services before making changes and start them again afterward.



2. Configuration Management
Apply Configuration Changes: After updating configuration files, handlers can trigger tasks to apply these changes.
Reconfigure Applications: Handlers can reconfigure applications or reload configurations dynamically based on file changes.


3. System Updates and Package Management
Restart System After Updates: After performing system updates, handlers can reboot the system if necessary.
Restart Applications After Package Updates: When specific packages are updated, handlers can restart the applications using those packages.


4. Networking
Restart Network Services: When network configurations change, handlers can restart network services to apply the new configurations.
Flush DNS Cache: After updating DNS settings, handlers can flush the DNS cache.


5. Database Management
Restart Database Services: When database configurations are updated, handlers can restart the database service.
Perform Database Backups: Before applying changes, handlers can trigger backups.


6. Web Servers
Reload Web Server Configuration: After deploying new application code or changing web server configurations, handlers can reload the web server.
Clear Cache: Clear the web server or application cache after deploying new code.


7. Security
Restart Security Services: After updating firewall rules or security configurations, handlers can restart the relevant services.
Update Security Policies: Apply new security policies dynamically based on configuration changes.


8. Monitoring and Logging
Restart Monitoring Services: When monitoring configurations are updated, handlers can restart the monitoring services.
Rotate Logs: Handlers can rotate logs if certain conditions are met, such as file size limits.


9. Application Deployment
Deploy Application Updates: Trigger deployment tasks based on code changes.
Restart Application Servers: Restart application servers after code deployment or configuration changes.

10. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Trigger Infrastructure Changes: Apply changes to the infrastructure based on configuration updates, such as modifying load balancers or DNS entries.
Run Health Checks: After changes, run health checks to ensure the system is functioning as expected.
